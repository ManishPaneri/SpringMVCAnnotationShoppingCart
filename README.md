Spring MVC Annotation ShoppingCart


Create a Java web application which creates Orders for an ecommerce flow. Your application should consist of Orders, Account,
Invertory tables. You need not implement cart functionality or other tables.

# Please Create functional apis for the following
  1. An api to create order (make sure all proper checks are in place)

# Please Note the following things:
  1. No Need of creating a user table, instead Account  table can conssit user's information too.
  
  2. Every user can order the same item multiple times as long as the inventory exists.
  
  3. Write comments in the code on how you will handle race conditions wherever necessary
  
  4. choose appropriate database for the flow (NoSQL or SQL type)
  

Your answer will be judged on the stack involved, data modelling, scenarios hanlded. Include as many minute details in the 
business logic. All details need not be coded if will take time, a simple TODO or comment will suffice. Your expertise in
structuring the code and handling all case related to a feature is what will be looked at.
